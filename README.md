<H1> COP3530 Project 3: UFOs-N-Trees </h1>
This is the template for Project 3 repositories. It includes all the assignment instructions and documentation to help you use GitHub.

## Getting Started with the Project

This is a group project. As such, you're expected to equally contribute to all parts of the project. To ensure everyone is contributing, we have moved this project entirely to GitHub and will use GitHub logs to understand your contributions. To fully leverage the features that GitHub offers, you have to be familiar with what they are and how to use them.

The goal of this project is to get you familiar with the creative process of software development for a general purpose use and how to use data structures or algorithms for those applications. To go with the professional development that the project offers in terms of general use application, you will also get more familiar with version control and GitHub platform to facilitate the collaborative work with extensive planning and organization abilities.

This step-by-step process is linked in this video **if you aren't familiar with GitHub**:

The following video has instructions on local development using Git and GitHub:

To illustrate the development process, we've also made a demo video to show how the GitHub flow looks like on an example:

Here are the instructions on how to Collaborate for Project 3 which are similar to what was covered in the Introduction to GitHub video. You may skip reading these if you have watched that video:

### Step 1: Create Your Project Repository

This is a template repository. If you want to know more about those, feel free to follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) to the GitHub documenation about templates and how to create them. You've used templates before for projects 1 and 2, and you will use it now, too. 

The first step of your project is to make your own repository for your own project that will host your source code and documentation. Only one member of the team needs to create a repo and everyone else copies that repo using git clone. 
1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the file list, in line with the repository name, click on the big green button saying **"Use this template"**
3. Select **"Create a new repository"** (This step is important. Do not open in codespace. Make your own repository for your own project.)

### Step 2: Repository Name and Visibility
